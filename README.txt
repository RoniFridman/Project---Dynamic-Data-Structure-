We needed in this project to implement a dynamic graph
with several capabilities including:
-Adding/Removing nodes and edges
- BFS
- DFS
- Computing the SCC of the graph
- Every rooted tree in the graph is able to print itself
  by layer

the file "test.java" can be used to see the wanted results.
